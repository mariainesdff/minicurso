/-! # Structures

A `structure` is a collection of data fields, possibly with restrictions that these fields must
satisfy.

An `instance` of a structure is a concrete collection of data that satisfy the constraints.

-/

/-- An element of ℝ³ is a tuple of three real numbers. -/
@[ext] structure R3 where
  x : ℝ
  y : ℝ
  z : ℝ

/- Marking the definition with the `@[ext]` tag makes Lean generate theorems to prove that two
terms of type `R3` are equals when their components agree. It will also allow us to use the `ext`
tactic on goals of that type. -/
/- What is the type of `R3`? -/
--#check R3

/- There are several ways to create an instance of the structure `R3` -/

/- If we do not know which fields we need to provide to create an instance of a structure, we can
replace the sorry by an underscore `_`, click on the lightbulb, and select the option
 "Generate a skeleton for the structure under construction".-/
noncomputable def R3_ex : R3 := sorry

-- This syntax also allows us to specify the fields in a different order.
--#check ({x := 1, z := 3.5, y := Real.sqrt 2,} : R3)

-- The default constructor is called `R3.mk`.
--#check R3.mk 1 (Real.sqrt 2) 3.5

-- We can also use the anonymous constructor syntax.
--#check (⟨1, Real.sqrt 2, 3.5⟩ : R3)

/- Two instances of `R3` are equal when their three fields agree. -/

example (a b : R3) (hx : a.x = b.x) (hy : a.y = b.y) (hz : a.z = b.z) : a = b := by
  ext
  exacts [hx, hy, hz] -- esta sintaxis nos permite cerrar las 3 metas a la vez.

/- Given an instance of `R3`, we can access each of the coordinates: -/

def v : R3 := ⟨1, 2, 3⟩
--#check R3.x
--#check v.z

/- Structures can also have propositional fields. -/

@[ext] structure R3_plus :=
(x y z : ℝ)
(x_pos : x > 0)
(y_pos : y > 0)
(z_pos : z > 0)

--#check R3_plus.mk

/- When are two terms of `R3_plus` equal? -/

example (a b : R3_plus) (hx : a.x = b.x) (hy : a.y = b.y) (hz : a.z = b.z) : a = b := by
  ext
  exacts [hx, hy, hz]

/- Lastly, we can also create structures with parameters. -/

/-- We define ℝ^n, where `n` is a natural number. -/
structure Rn (n : ℕ) where
  coeff : Fin n → ℝ

--variable (n :  ℕ)
--#check Rn n

--#check Rn.mk
--#check Rn.mk (λ (k : Fin 5) ↦ k)
--def ex : Rn 5 := ⟨(λ k ↦ k)⟩

/-- The following definition is different: it includes n-tuples of real numbers for any `n`. -/
structure Rn' where
  n : ℕ
  coeff : Fin n → ℝ

--#check Rn'.mk 5 (λ k ↦ k)

## Exercises about creation of structures
In the following exercises, you are asked to create a structure in Lean to represent each of the
described mathematical objects. The proposed solutions are not always unique; please ask me if
you are not sure of whether your solution is correct.

/- Create a type `EvenNaturalNumber`, consisting of pairs in thich the first component is a natural
number and the second is a proof that the number is even. -/
structure EvenNaturalNumber : Type :=
-- TODO

/- Define a structure of eventually constant sequences `ℕ → ℕ`. The first field will be a sequence
  `seq : ℕ → ℕ`, and the second will be the statement that `seq` satisfies the desired property. -/
structure EventConstSeq :=
-- TODO

/- Define a structure whose terms are two distinct natural numbers. -/
structure TwoDistinctPoints :=
-- TODO

/- Define a multiplicative group structure on a type `G`. To do this, you will need data fields to
indicate the operations and the identity element, and propositional fields to establish the desired
axioms. -/
structure MyGroup (G : Type) :=
-- TODO
